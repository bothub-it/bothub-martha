                This proof of concept was created by Ilhasoft to demonstrate how chatbots and artificial intelligence can be used by WHO and partners as a part of the COVID-19 disease outbreak response.

This solution was created in only 48 hours for demonstration purposes, this being a good example of how easily and rapidly communication initiatives can be rolled out using these technologies. The created datasets currently support two languages and can be continuously  improved as more tests are run and results are monitored. This will be better detailed on the roadmap section of this page.

          <h2 data-aos="fade-in">Context</h2>
          <p data-aos="fade-in">The coronavirus epidemic originating in Wuhan, China, has emerged as a major global public health crisis. More and more citizens have been under quarantine since January as cases spread to all continents and higher detection numbers are seen. The virus continues to spread and the number of infections and deaths rises each day, raising the need of a collective coordinated and comprehensive response engaging all stakeholders.

Curated information delivery and data collection, as well as controlling misinformation, is essential for an effective battle against the virus. People need to be able to easily get accurate information about the thread they are facing and how to protect themselves.

          <h2 data-aos="fade-in">The Prototype</h2>
          <p data-aos="fade-in">The Prototype is prepared by Ilhasoft for UNICEF ECAR. The content and structure for the chatbot was based on an informative campaign built by UNICEF for the U-Report program.

The bot can provide information about the following topics:

general concepts and what is COVID-19, how does it spread, symptoms,
protection for yourself and for others,
myths and
how to wear masks.
</p>
</br>
<p data-aos="fade-in">
  Messages about each of these topics are automatically detected. People can interact through the bot's conversation structure or send questions around those topics. The bot then responds with precise, direct and quick information about it instead of relying on specific keywords to route the conversation. This type of approach usually results in higher engagement rates and more effective communication interactions.
</p>
</br>
<p data-aos="fade-in">
  Updated information about the number of cases, deaths and other variables can be manually updated through a centralized and friendly portal, but this can be switched to an automatic approach if WHO provides APIs for the system to connect and fetch those metrics.

              <p >Bothub was created with the support of UNICEF's Innovation Fund by Ilhasoft after years of experience working with RapidPro and communication programs. It is an Artificial Intelligence (A.I), Natural Language Processing (NLP) intuitive and open source platform that is natively integrated with RapidPro and can be easily integrated with other systems through its APIs. It currently supports 29 languages (70 new languages are expected to be added by the end of 2020), supports the translation of phrases for multi-language support, collaboration and the usage of existing, public datasets.

Bothub has a powerful feature for testing datasets, a central tool that enables the continuous improvement of intent and entity detection. These are its current results:
Precision and recall,
Intent confusion matrix and
Intent confidence distribution.

            <div class="portfolio-wrap">
            <p >The intelligence currently supports 7 intents (listed above) and has 140 training phrases. The goal is to reach 500 as real interactions are done with humans and improvements are mapped. It is important to stress the need of a validation and testing period for the intelligence to ensure there is a minimum level of accuracy and reliability going beyond demonstration purposes and for the general public.

Bothub can also be integrated with other WHO systems for text classification. New datasets can be created depending on the specific purpose.

            <p >The conversation engine uses RapidPro, a mature and powerful open source platform widely used by UNICEF for U-Report and other initiatives. The technology allows users to design, pilot and scale direct mobile outreach services without the help of a software developer in both normal development contexts and humanitarian emergencies. You can find out more about it <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innovation/rapidpro">here</a>.

            <p >It is currently structured across six flows (this is how RapidPro names conversational structures) and supports english, but can be translated to other languages very easily. The bot, whose name is HealthyBuddy, was structured through the creation of a persona. Personas can help to engage with people, but an alternative is to remove the identity and use a neutral bot without mimicking human behavior.

These are some of the channels supported: Web widget, SMS, Facebook Messenger, IVR, Viber, Twitter, Whatsapp, Vk (Coming soon) and more.
